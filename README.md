# EcoScreen-Studio
——A Sustainable Reinvention of Screen Printing
## How might we reinterpret the screen printing process in small-scale FabLab settings using stickers, woodworking, and special inks— making it more accessible, eco-friendly, and creatively engaging?
EcoScreen Studio centers on the principles of simplicity and sustainability, rethinking the traditional screen-printing process.
It abandons complex chemical plate-making and industrial machinery, transforming screen printing into a low-tech, eco-friendly, and accessible form of creative practice.
Its design goals are to optimize printing procedures and address practical challenges in production; lower technical barriers so that more people can engage in screen-printing activities; reduce pollution and waste through the use of sustainable materials; and reestablish printing as a handcrafted art form that fosters dialogue between people and materials.

### System Structure
The system integrates four redesigned functional modules:
1. Sticker Mask System
Printed adhesive films are used in place of photosensitive emulsions, eliminating chemical exposure and the need for UV development. This method is eco-friendly, reduces environmental pollution caused by chemical agents, and at the same time simplifies the process and minimizes errors during operation.
2. Rod-Locked Wooden Frame
Fine wooden rods are installed around the frame. After the mesh is stretched, it is secured through the rods to create natural tension, eliminating the need for a professional stretching machine. The frame is easy to tighten, reusable, and user-friendly.
3. Sliding Squeegee Mechanism
Wooden rods are designed with slots to hold squeegees of different sizes.During printing, the rods are placed across the wooden screen frame, allowing the user to apply even pressure by simply sliding the rod.This design ensures smoother, more consistent, and easier operation.
4. Hybrid Ink Composition
A water-soluble eco-friendly ink is used as the base layer, upon which a layer of foam ink is printed.After the foam ink is cured, the water-soluble ink is washed away, leaving behind a raised pattern.This process creates a three-dimensional tactile effect and visual depth in the printed design.

## Process Documentation:
During the class session, we engaged in brainstorming and created preliminary sketches of the concept.

After class, we continued to refine our ideas and finalized the overall design.
In the prototyping phase, we used wooden sticks and other accessible materials to construct the model, and visualized the project through a poster designed in Adobe Illustrator.
