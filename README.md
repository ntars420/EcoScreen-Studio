# Printed Dimension（印之维度）: Reconstructing Screen Printing in Three Dimensions
### How might we, in a low-tech FabLab environment, explore innovative printing materials and techniques to reinvent screen printing and create three-dimensional works?
### Design Description：
The project explores the transformation of screen printing from a two-dimensional process to a three-dimensional form.
By using innovative media such as UV glue, water-soluble materials, and foaming inks — and experimenting with different material combinations and fabrication methods — we aim to free screen printing from its traditional flat expression, turning it into a malleable and constructive three-dimensional craft.
This experiment challenges the conventional notion of “printing = image,” redefining the process of screen printing as a generative act of interaction between material, space, and craftsmanship.



## System Overview

### Dissolvable Structure Printing（可溶支撑立体印刷）
Application: 3D hollow prints on garments and textiles.

## Process Documentation:
During the class session, we engaged in brainstorming and created preliminary sketches of the concept.

After class, we continued to refine our ideas and finalized the overall design.

In the prototyping phase, we used wooden sticks and other accessible materials to construct the mock-up, and visualized the project through a poster designed in Adobe Illustrator.

The improved screen printing tool is mainly divided into two parts: a frame with spines itself and covers used to fix the four sides. The specific usage is as follows: Embed the screen on the spiny fixtures, press the covers on the four sides in sequence to fix the screen firmly and tighten it, then proceed with subsequent processing. 

The model production steps are as follows: First, for the main frame part, bond the wooden strips end to end to form a rectangle. The bonded parts may need secondary reinforcement to ensure the stability of the frame. Next is the connection of the spiny fixtures. Since the plastic strips used for making the model are very small in size and to ensure their firmness, I used hot-melt adhesive, which still adheres very firmly after cooling. Then, for the cover part, several covers have the same size, with the length equal to the side length of the frame. They adopt a 5-sided enclosed structure, leaving one of the long sides to close and fix with the spiny fixtures. Adding a spring at the connection can enhance the fixing strength.
