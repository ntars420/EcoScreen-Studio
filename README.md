# Printed Dimension（印之维度）: Reconstructing Screen Printing in Three Dimensions
### How might we, in a low-tech FabLab environment, explore innovative printing materials and techniques to reinvent screen printing and create three-dimensional works?
## 1.Design Description：
The project explores the transformation of screen printing from a two-dimensional process to a three-dimensional form.
By using innovative media such as UV glue, water-soluble materials, and foaming inks — and experimenting with different material combinations and fabrication methods — we aim to free screen printing from its traditional flat expression, turning it into a malleable and constructive three-dimensional craft.
This experiment challenges the conventional notion of “printing = image,” redefining the process of screen printing as a generative act of interaction between material, space, and craftsmanship.


## 2.Process Documentation:
### Brainstorming
During the class session, we engaged in brainstorming and created preliminary sketches of the concept.Initially, we began by discussing existing screen printing processes to explore innovation possibilities. Our exploration ranged from modular magnetic wood frames to segmented screens, and even considering replacing photosensitive ink with stickers.

Ultimately, we settled on using printed stickers as plate substitutes, with ultra-thin wooden rods installed around the frames. After tensioning the screen, we secured it through these rods to create natural tension in our process design, resulting in the physical model shown below.

This led us to consider future functional innovations—experimenting with 2D templates to achieve 3D printing effects. Through brainstorming sessions, we discarded approaches like solution crystallization, water-soluble support with single-layer permanent structures, and mold-like printing. Gradually, we identified three relatively feasible 3D printing solutions.

## Three Possible Answers

### Dissolvable Structure Printing（可溶支撑立体印刷）
Application: 3D hollow prints on garments and textiles.

### Layered Relief Printing（多层浮雕印刷）
Application: 3D fabric prints, small sculptural objects, and tactile artworks.

### Model making
In the prototyping phase, we used wooden sticks and other accessible materials to construct the mock-up, and visualized the project through a poster designed in Adobe Illustrator.

The improved screen printing tool is mainly divided into two parts: a frame with spines itself and covers used to fix the four sides. The specific usage is as follows: Embed the screen on the spiny fixtures, press the covers on the four sides in sequence to fix the screen firmly and tighten it, then proceed with subsequent processing. 

The model production steps are as follows: First, for the main frame part, bond the wooden strips end to end to form a rectangle. The bonded parts may need secondary reinforcement to ensure the stability of the frame. Next is the connection of the spiny fixtures. Since the plastic strips used for making the model are very small in size and to ensure their firmness, I used hot-melt adhesive, which still adheres very firmly after cooling. Then, for the cover part, several covers have the same size, with the length equal to the side length of the frame. They adopt a 5-sided enclosed structure, leaving one of the long sides to close and fix with the spiny fixtures. Adding a spring at the connection can enhance the fixing strength.

## 3.Feedback
We came to the Makerfaire and received some comments and advices from visiters.

Several design students showed strong interest in our project, saying that the idea of “constructing form through printing” felt refreshing and original.
One of them commented, “It’s like realizing the idea of 3D printing by hand — very inspiring.”
They also raised several questions:
In water-soluble support printing, is the dissolution effect of the soluble material stable?
What about the cost of these innovative materials (UV resin, water-soluble media, foaming ink, etc.)?
Regarding the dissolution effect, we mentioned that further experiments would be needed to verify it. As for materials, we chose commonly available, low-cost substances that can easily be sourced and used in a fab lab context.
After our explanation, many students said they were eager to try applying this technique to their own design assignments.

A teacher from another university also affirmed our project, describing it as “a bold exploration in material experimentation and process innovation.”
He provided some valuable suggestions on feasibility — for example, how to control the growth cycle and form of the bio-ink printing, and how the viscosity of UV resin might affect the mesh permeability. He suggested we try adjusting viscosity by heating or dilution.
These comments helped us realize that our proposal is still in an early stage, but also offered important insights for improvement.

A young boy, around seven or eight years old, was drawn to the printed textures on our poster.
We explained the basic principle of screen printing to him, and his parent remarked that our project had both educational and playful qualities, making it suitable for children’s workshops and art activities.
They suggested that this kind of 3D print pattern could be great for decorating children’s products, while also reminding us that the safety of the special inks and materials would be an important consideration.

## 4.Refletion
We believe that our plan has innovative potential in areas such as clothing decoration and artistic creation. During the Maker faire experience, we realized that we did not create a physical model of the innovative ink application, which led to an unclear explanation of our solution to the audience. Meanwhile, our plan is merely a conception and lacks experimentation, thus making it difficult to answer some of the questions raised by the audience. Furthermore, we have developed three different directions instead of concentrating on one plan, which has led to our project being less complete and mature. Therefore, we need to choose one direction and deepen it instead of working on three projects simultaneously. In the future, we need to conduct more experiments to verify the feasibility of the plan.


## 5.Future Directions
Considering the innovation of the scheme, theoretical printing quality and other aspects, we decided to choose the direction of Dissolvable Structure Printing for deepening.

Short-term goal: Conduct tests in fablab to verify the feasibility of the materials.

Long-term goal: Collaborate with designers in the fashion field to create practical products.
